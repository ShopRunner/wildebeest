    Calculate difference hash of image.

    As a rule of thumb, with `sqrt_hash_size=8`, hashes from two images
    should typically have a Hamming distance less than 10 if and only if
    those images are "duplicates", with some robustness to sources of
    noise such as resizing and JPEG artifacts, where the Hamming
    distance between two hashes `a` and `b` is computed as
    `bin(a ^ b).count("1")`.

    Assumes image is grayscale, RGB, or RGBA.
