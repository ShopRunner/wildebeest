# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

# [2.1.0] - 2020-6-3
### Added
 - Function to report whether an image is grayscale.

# [2.0.0] - 2020-4-21
### Changed
 - Pipelines now take a function to decide whether to skip a file based on its input and output paths, rather than just providing the option to skip files whose outpath points to a local file. "skipped_existing" field of run report has been renamed to "skipped" accordingly.
 - Run report is now stored in `<Pipeline object>.run_report_` rather than being returned.
 - All exceptions that inherit from `Exception` that arise during file processing are now handled by default.
 - Rather than noting whether an exception was handled in processing a particular file in an "exception_handled" field, the run report now contains either the exception object itself or `np.nan` in a field called "error."
 - "time_finished" field in run reports now uses human-readable timestamps.
 - `Pipeline.run()` method has been removed; now pipelines can only be called directly.
 - `Pipeline.ops` is now `None` by default.
 - Moved most of the README content to readthedocs, improved the examples, and added docstrings.
 - `log_dict` is now a Pipeline attribute.
 - `pipelines/core.py` has been renamed to `pipelines/pipelines.py`

 - `write_image` writes to a tempfile in a ".tmp" subdirectory in the output directory rather than in an arbitrary location to avoid issues when writing to a mounted volume.

# [1.6.2] - 2020-2-28
